# Vlsir Julia Bindings

This folder contains the build scripts of the VLSIR Julia Bindings. To run them, run the following:

NOTE: This script must be run from the Vlsir root directory

```
$ scripts/build_julia.sh
```

These can then be imported as a dev package to your Julia REPL Package Manager using the command:

```
dev relative/path/to/julia/bindings
```
