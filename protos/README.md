# VLSIR ProtoBuf Schema 

Schema descriptions for the [VLSIR](https://github.com/Vlsir/Vlsir) IC design interchange formats.  
Defined in the [Google Protocol Buffers](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers) schema description language. 

Bindings to supported languages are distributed through the [Vlsir](https://github.com/Vlsir/Vlsir) repository, 
and where applicable the language-specific package managers (PyPi, NPM, crates.io, etc). 

The official bindings are highly recommended whenever applicable. 
To bind to an unsupported language or customize the ProtoBuf compilation process, 
clone the schema-description files in this repository. 

## Versioning

Stable releases will be tagged with a version number, i.e. `v1.0.0`.
